# Chronos Validator Client Implementation

_This is the main project folder for a validator client implementation of Over Protocol written in Go. Since Chronos is a fork of [Prysm](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm) from [Prysmatic Labs](https://prysmaticlabs.com), you can refer to [Prysm's documentation portal](https://docs.prylabs.network)._

A validator client attaches to a running beacon node in order to perform proposer/attester responsibilities for eth.

You can also read our main [documentation](https://docs.over.network/) and join our active chat room on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/overprotocol).

To further understand the responsibilities of an Over validator, we recommend reading the official Ethereum specification [here](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/master/specs/phase0/validator.md)
